            Being a Web Developer is not without its challenges, however, as the
            field involves continuous learning, problem-solving, and critical
            thinking. This is a field that never stops changing as new
            technologies, best practices, and other innovations are introduced,
            which means Web and Software Developers have to work hard to keep
            current on the latest coding languages and industry trends to ensure
            they stay relevant over the course of their web development careers.

            More than 80 percent of Web Developers are employed full-time, with
            another 10 percent working on a freelance basis or part-time
            according to Stack Overflow. That number isnâ€™t expected to decrease,
            since virtually every company you could think of in every industry
            you could think of hires Web Developers. That explains in part why
            so many potential job changers are learning web development.
